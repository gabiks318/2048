## Implementation approach

We will use Flutter to develop the 2048 game, leveraging the built-in features and widgets for UI design and game logic implementation. We will also utilize open-source libraries for any additional functionalities needed.

## File list

- main.dart
- game_logic.dart
- ui_components.dart

## Data structures and interfaces


class Game {
        -List<List<int>> board
        -int score
        +Game()
        +void startNewGame()
        +void move(Direction direction)
        +bool isGameOver()
    }
    class Tile {
        -int value
        +Tile(int value)
    }
    enum Direction {
        up,
        down,
        left,
        right
    }
    Game --> Tile


## Program call flow

    participant G as Game
    participant UI as UI

    UI->>G: move(direction)
    G->>G: isGameOver()
    G->>UI: showGameOverScreen()
